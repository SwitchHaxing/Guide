A complete guide to Switch homebrew, from stock to being able to run some Homebrew.

## What is this?

This is the [SwitchHaxing](https://reddit.com/r/switchhaxing) Homebrew Guide! [Here's the webpage.](https://switchhaxing.github.io)

## Okay, what can we do so far?

You can run basic Homebrew, like DOOM. But only on firmwares 3.0.0 and below.
1.0.0 will likely have emuNAND support by the end of the year, and eventually CFW will be a thing on 1.0.0, but it's unknown whether or not it will happen past that.

## What can I do on firmwares 3.0.1 to latest?

Nothing. Sorry :/
