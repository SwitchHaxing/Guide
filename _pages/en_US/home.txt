## What is Homebrew?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) usually refers to software that is not authorized by Nintendo. It allows you to run homebrew games, tools like save editing and backup, and emulators for various older systems.

The only exploit that we have at the moment is PegaSwitch, while a few others seem to be in development.

## What is Custom Firmware?

**Custom Firmware** ("CFW") enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can't easily do. For instance, signature patches let you install unsigned titles that appear right on your HOME Menu.

CFW currently does not exist for the Nintendo Switch as of now. 1.0.0 is currently the best firmware for a possible CFW release.

## What does this guide install?

Nothing; the end result will allow you to run Homebrew applications on your console without needing to install anything directly.

## What do I need to know before starting?

+ **Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of Switch hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They're rare, but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY.**
+ This guide will work on the Switch on firmware 3.0.0 or below. Anything above does not currently have available exploits.
+ If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, NNID, saves, etc will be preserved).
+ Keep your device plugged in and charged throughout the entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off!
