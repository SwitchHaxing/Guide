## What is Homebrew?

[**Homebrew**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_homebrew_video_games) usually refers to software that is not authorized by Nintendo. It allows you to run homebrew games, tools like save editing and backup, and emulators for various older systems.

The only exploit that we have at the moment is PegaSwitch.

## What is Custom Firmware?

**Custom Firmware** ("CFW") enables you to use more advanced hacks that userland homebrew can't easily do. For instance, signature patches let you install unsigned titles that appear right on your HOME Menu.

CFW can be set up on any console on any version (but may require additional tools / accessories for versions >11.3.0).

## What does this guide install?

Who knows.

## What can I do with Custom Firmware?

CFW is not on the Switch :(

## What do I need to know before starting?

+ **Before beginning the guide, you must know the risks of 3DS hacking: EVERY time you modify your system, there is always the potential for an UNRECOVERABLE brick. They're rare, but still a possibility so make sure you follow ALL directions EXACTLY.**
+ This guide will work on the Switch on firmware 3.0.0 or below.
+ If everything goes according to plan, you will lose no data and end up with everything that you started with (games, NNID, saves, etc will be preserved).
+ Keep your device plugged in and charged throughout the entire process to avoid data loss or damage from an unexpected power-off!
+ Your SD card should be [MBR, not GPT](http://www.howtogeek.com/245610/) (the SD card that comes with your device will be MBR by default).
+ If you need to format a brand new SD card, you can use [`guiformat`](http://www.ridgecrop.demon.co.uk/index.htm?guiformat.htm) and set to an Allocation Unit Size of 32K.
